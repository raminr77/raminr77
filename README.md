### Hi Guys ✋🏻 I'm **Ramin**
I used to be a graphic designer but then I fell in love with programming. I am currently a **front-end** programmer, and a little bit of **back-end** as well. I love solving bugs and problems and I like creating websites. I really believe that nothing is more important and exciting than learning and teaching web-based technologies and there is still so much for me to learn.
