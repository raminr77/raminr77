### Hi Guys ✋🏻 I'm **Ramin**
I used to be a graphic designer but then I fell in love with programming.
I am currently a **front-end engineer** with more than **4 years** of experience and a little bit of back-end development. And now I work for **Digikala**. which is the largest online store in Iran with about 9 million visits per day. Digikala is an Iranian example for Amazon.
<br />
I love solving bugs and problems and I like creating web pages whit new ideas. I really believe that nothing is more important and exciting than learning and teaching web-based technologies and there is still so much for me to learn. I am incredibly patient and friendly with my co-workers and teammates and socialize well with people. Basically, if you have some coffee or Nescafe, I can work with you!
